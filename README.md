Regex Search++
===============

This is a chrome extension based on the open source extension
[regex-search](https://github.com/gsingh93/regex-search). The original extension
is based on some frameworks, such as
[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), and the build tools
[nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) as well as
[tsd](https://npmjs.org/package/tsd). In contrast, our version uses the readily
built source code and reduces the complexity of the resulting plugin. We use
plain JS, html5 and css3.

Features
--------

1. Search for regular expression in the DOM of the web page.
2. Navigate through the highlighted results with the next and prev buttons.
3. Copy search results as json list of strings to the clipboard (new).
4. Material design of the widget (new).

How to get it
-------------

Reg Search is still unpublished.

You can install it by cloning the repository and adding it as extension to your
chrome browser from your file system.
